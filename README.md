# AI Alternate Histories

A lightweight static site for exploring AI-generated alternate histories and geography. It includes:

- **Home** — introduction and featured speculative art prompts.
- **Timeline Lab** — interactive historical timeline that spawns counterfactual branches with story beats and AI art direction cues.
- **Global Atlas** — stylized world map where each region reveals an atmospheric vignette for multiple eras.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the experience. The pages are fully client-side and require no build step.
